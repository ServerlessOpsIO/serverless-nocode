# serverless-nocode

[![serverless](http://public.serverless.com/badges/v3.svg)](http://www.serverless.com) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/serverless-nocode.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/serverless-nocode)

Serverless Framework plugin to convert service to deployable nocode.

This plugin will remove all code and AWS resources from your serverless system.  You will be left with nothing.  There will be NOTHING left of your service.

However, you will have achieved a higher order of abstraction than anyone has previously dreamed of.  Your conference submissions on this experience will be met with awe and wonderment.  After deploying this you will never have to show up to work again. In fact, your employer will probably ask you to never show up again.  But that doesn't matter because if you combine this with blockchain then VCs will give you money.

__WARNING: Nocode can be intense!!! Ensure you can handle converting your serverless systems to nocode in a controlled and disposable environment that you will not miss.__


Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml` file:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-nocode
```

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-nocode
```
